# Dayly App - Implementation Prompts

This directory contains complete, ready-to-use prompts for implementing the Dayly app in 10 phases. Each prompt includes full context and can be given directly to an AI coding assistant.

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Start with Phase 0** - Set up the foundation
2. **Give each prompt completely** - Copy the entire file content
3. **Test after each phase** - Ensure it works before moving on
4. **Update context between phases** - Let the AI know what was built

## Supporting Files

- **`SHARED_CONTEXT.md`** - Common context about the app (include with each prompt)
- **`README.md`** - This file

## Total Timeline

- **Development:** 40-50 hours (7-10 days at 5-6 hours/day)
- **Testing:** Additional 1-2 days
- **Deployment:** 1 day

## Tips for Success

1. **Include Context:** Always include SHARED_CONTEXT.md with phase prompts
2. **Test Incrementally:** Don't skip testing between phases
3. **Handle Errors:** If something fails, provide error details to AI
4. **Stay Focused:** Each phase has clear boundaries - don't expand scope

## Example Usage

```
Hey AI, I need you to implement Phase 1 of the Dayly app.

[Copy ALL content from SHARED_CONTEXT.md]

[Copy ALL content from PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md]

Please implement all the files and features described above.
