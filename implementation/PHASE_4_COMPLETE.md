# Phase 4: Camera & Photo Capture - COMPLETE âœ…

## All Tasks Completed

### 1. âœ… Camera Service
Created a comprehensive AVFoundation-based camera service:
- Permission handling (check and request)
- Session management (start/stop)
- Photo capture with async/await
- Camera switching (front/back)
- Flash toggle
- Proper orientation handling

### 2. âœ… Camera UI Components
Implemented all camera-related views:
- **CameraView**: Main camera interface with controls
- **CameraPreviewView**: UIViewRepresentable for live preview
- **PhotoPreviewView**: 3-second auto-send timer with manual options
- **DaylyLimitView**: Countdown to midnight when limit reached

### 3. âœ… Daily Limit Enforcement
- Check daily send status before allowing capture
- Show countdown when already sent today
- Backend endpoints for checking/marking daily sends
- Local Core Data tracking as fallback

### 4. âœ… Image Processing
Created ImageProcessor utility:
- Resize images to max 2048x2048
- Strip EXIF data for privacy
- Fix orientation issues
- JPEG compression at 0.8 quality
- Thumbnail generation support

### 5. âœ… Integration
- Updated GroupsListView to navigate to camera on tap
- Added fullScreenCover for camera presentation
- Camera permissions in Info.plist
- Core Data Daily_sends entity added

## Features Implemented

### Camera Experience
- **Beautiful UI**: Dark overlay with white controls
- **Auto-send Timer**: 3-second countdown with visual progress
- **Manual Controls**: Send now or retake options
- **Group Context**: Shows which group you're sending to
- **Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of denied permissions

### Daily Limit
- **Smart Checking**: API first, local fallback
- **Beautiful Countdown**: Shows exact time until midnight
- **Motivational Message**: "See you tomorrow! ðŸŒ…"
- **Per-Group Tracking**: Different limits for each group

### Image Quality
- **Optimized Size**: Max 2048px for fast uploads
- **Privacy First**: EXIF data stripped
- **Correct Orientation**: Handles all device orientations
- **Efficient Storage**: JPEG compression reduces size

## Backend API Additions

### New Endpoints
1. `GET /api/groups/{group_id}/daily-status` - Check if sent today
2. `POST /api/groups/{group_id}/mark-sent` - Mark as sent today

Both endpoints verify group membership before proceeding.

## Design Decisions

1. **3-Second Timer**: Quick enough to not annoy, long enough to change mind
2. **Full Screen Camera**: Immersive experience
3. **Dark UI**: Better for camera preview visibility
4. **Auto-send Default**: Reduces friction for daily use
5. **Local First**: Save locally before upload for reliability

## Next Steps (Phase 5)

Photo upload system will:
- Upload to Supabase Storage
- Handle retry logic
- Show upload progress
- Update remote database
- Handle offline queue

## Testing the Implementation

### iOS Testing
1. Tap any group to open camera
2. Grant camera permissions when prompted
3. Take a photo
4. Watch 3-second timer or tap "Send Photo"
5. Try to take another photo - see daily limit
6. Check countdown timer updates every second

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Check daily status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/groups/GROUP_ID/daily-status

# Mark as sent
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/groups/GROUP_ID/mark-sent
```

## Success Criteria Met âœ…
- [x] Camera opens when tapping group
- [x] Can capture photos with flash/camera toggle
- [x] Preview auto-advances after 3 seconds
- [x] Daily limit enforced per group
- [x] Countdown timer shows time until midnight
- [x] Images processed (resized, EXIF stripped)
- [x] Error states handled gracefully
- [x] Photos saved locally via repository
- [x] Camera permissions handled properly

Phase 4 is complete! The app now has a fully functional camera system with daily limit enforcement.
