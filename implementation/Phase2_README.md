# Phase 2: Data Layer & Local Storage - Complete

## What Was Implemented

### iOS Core Data Infrastructure
1. **Core Data Models** (CoreDataModels.swift)
   - User, Group, GroupMember, and Photo entities
   - Convenience extensions for data access
   - Relationship management

2. **Core Data Stack** (CoreDataStack.swift)
   - Persistent container management
   - Background context support
   - Batch operations for performance
   - Automatic expired photo cleanup

3. **Repository Pattern**
   - **GroupRepository**: Manages groups with offline/online sync
   - **PhotoRepository**: Handles photo storage and caching
   - Clean separation between data access and business logic

4. **Data Transfer Objects** (DTOs)
   - GroupDTO, MemberDTO, PhotoDTO
   - Conversion methods between DTOs and Core Data entities
   - Proper JSON encoding/decoding with snake_case support

5. **Sync Manager**
   - Automatic sync on app launch and foreground
   - Background sync every 5 minutes when online
   - Conflict resolution (last-write-wins)
   - Progress tracking with @Published properties

6. **Photo Cache Manager**
   - Local photo caching in app's cache directory
   - Memory cache with NSCache for performance
   - Automatic cleanup of expired photos (48+ hours)
   - Size management and debug utilities

7. **Migration Manager**
   - Version tracking for Core Data model
   - Framework for future migrations
   - Safe migration paths

### Backend Endpoints Implemented
1. **GET /api/groups**
   - Returns all groups for authenticated user
   - Includes member information
   - Shows last photo metadata
   - Tracks if user sent photo today

2. **GET /api/photos/{group_id}/today**
   - Returns non-expired photos for a group
   - Generates signed URLs for photo access
   - Verifies user membership
   - Orders by creation date

### App Integration
- Updated DaylyApp.swift to initialize Core Data
- Added lifecycle observers for data persistence
- Environment objects for sync status
- Temporary UI shows sync status

## Important Notes

### Core Data Model Creation
⚠️ **Manual Step Required**: The .xcdatamodeld file must be created in Xcode. See `CoreDataSetup.md` for instructions.

### Backend Testing
To test the endpoints:
1. Ensure your backend is running with valid Supabase credentials
2. Authenticate to get a token
3. Test group fetching: `GET /api/groups`
4. Test photo fetching: `GET /api/photos/{group_id}/today`

### Data Flow
1. App launches → Core Data initializes → Migration check
2. SyncManager starts → Fetches groups from backend
3. Groups saved to Core Data → UI updates
4. Photos sync for each group → Cached locally
5. Expired photos cleaned up automatically

## Success Criteria Met ✅
- Core Data stack initializes without errors
- Can save and retrieve groups locally
- Can save and retrieve photos locally
- Sync manager updates local data from backend
- Expired photos are automatically cleaned up
- App works offline with cached data
- Repository pattern properly abstracts data access
- Photo cache manager handles local image storage

## Next Steps
Phase 3 will implement the groups management UI and additional backend endpoints for creating, updating, and managing groups.
