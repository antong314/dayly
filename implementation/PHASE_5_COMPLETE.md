# Phase 5: Photo Upload & Sync - COMPLETE ✅

## All Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Photo Upload Service
Created comprehensive upload infrastructure:
- Queue-based upload management
- Operation-based architecture for cancellation
- Progress tracking with Combine publishers
- Failed upload tracking for retry

### 2. ✅ Background Upload Manager
Implemented iOS background upload support:
- URLSession background configuration
- Session delegate for progress tracking
- Background task completion handling
- App delegate integration

### 3. ✅ Retry Logic
Built robust retry system:
- Exponential backoff with configurable delays
- Smart error detection (network vs permanent)
- Maximum retry limits
- Retry-aware network extensions

### 4. ✅ Backend Upload API
Updated photos API with:
- Multi-part form upload endpoint
- File validation (size, type)
- Daily limit enforcement
- Supabase Storage integration
- Upload confirmation flow

### 5. ✅ Photo Sync
Enhanced SyncManager:
- Download photos from other group members
- Local caching with PhotoCacheManager
- Expired photo cleanup
- Offline-first architecture

### 6. ✅ Upload Progress UI
Added visual feedback:
- Linear progress bar in GroupCard
- Percentage display
- Smooth animations
- Auto-refresh on completion

## Features Implemented

### Upload Flow
1. **Camera Capture** → Process image → Queue upload
2. **Upload Queue** → Single concurrent upload → Progress tracking
3. **Background Support** → Continue uploads when app closed
4. **Retry Logic** → Exponential backoff → Max 3 attempts
5. **Sync** → Download others' photos → Cache locally

### Backend Integration
- `POST /api/photos/upload` - Main upload endpoint
- `POST /api/photos/upload-url` - Get signed URL (future)
- `POST /api/photos/confirm-upload` - Confirm completion
- File validation and storage path generation

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time upload progress (0-100%)
- Visual progress bar in group cards
- Background upload notifications
- Completion triggers sync

## Technical Decisions

1. **Operation Queue**: Better control than URLSession tasks
2. **Background URLSession**: For reliability
3. **Multipart Upload**: Standard for file + metadata
4. **Local First**: Save locally before upload
5. **Exponential Backoff**: Prevent server overload

## Error Handling

### Network Errors
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Queue persists across app launches
- User notification on final failure

### Storage Errors
- Cleanup on failure
- Rollback database changes
- Clear error messaging

### Quota Errors
- Daily limit checked before upload
- Clear user feedback
- No retry for quota errors

## Testing the Implementation

### iOS Testing
1. Take a photo → See upload progress
2. Kill app during upload → Resumes in background
3. Turn off network → Queues for retry
4. Turn on network → Auto-retries with backoff
5. Check other device → Photo syncs down

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test upload endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/photos/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.jpg" \
  -F "group_id=GROUP_UUID"

# Check today's photos
curl http://localhost:8000/api/photos/GROUP_ID/today \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

## Optimizations Made

1. **Smart Sync**: Only download photos not cached
2. **Progress Batching**: Reduce UI updates
3. **Memory Efficient**: Stream large files
4. **Cleanup**: Auto-delete expired photos
5. **Deduplication**: Check before re-uploading

## Next Steps (Phase 6)

Photo viewing experience will add:
- Full-screen photo viewer
- Swipe between photos
- Sender info overlay
- Auto-advance timer
- Gesture controls

## Success Criteria Met ✅
- [x] Photos upload to Supabase Storage
- [x] Upload progress shown in UI
- [x] Background uploads continue when app closed
- [x] Failed uploads retry automatically
- [x] Daily send limit enforced on backend
- [x] Photos sync across devices
- [x] Signed URLs work for viewing
- [x] 48-hour cleanup functions
- [x] Offline queue for uploads

Phase 5 is complete! The app now has a robust photo upload and sync system with excellent reliability.
