# Supabase Setup Complete ✅

All database tables, Row Level Security policies, and storage buckets have been successfully created using the Supabase CLI.

## What Was Created

### 1. Database Tables ✅
- `profiles` - User profiles linked to auth.users
- `groups` - Group information
- `group_members` - Group membership tracking
- `photos` - Photo metadata with auto-expiration
- `daily_sends` - Track daily photo sends per group
- `invites` - Group invite codes
- `user_devices` - Push notification tokens

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) ✅
All tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies:
- Users can only view/edit their own profiles
- Users can only see groups they belong to
- Users can only see photos in their groups
- All access is properly restricted

### 3. Storage Bucket ✅
- Bucket name: `photos`
- Public: No (requires authentication)
- File size limit: 10MB
- Allowed types: JPEG, JPG, PNG, HEIC, HEIF
- Storage policies enforce group membership

### 4. Automatic Features
- Photos automatically expire after 48 hours
- Storage files are cleaned up when photo records are deleted
- Proper indexes for performance

## Verification Results
```
✓ All 7 tables exist and are accessible
✓ Storage bucket 'photos' is configured
✓ RLS is active on all tables
✓ Anonymous access is properly blocked
```

## Backend Endpoints Ready
The following endpoints are now fully functional:
- `GET /api/groups` - Returns user's groups with member info
- `GET /api/photos/{group_id}/today` - Returns today's photos

## Next Steps
You can now:
1. Test the authentication flow with real phone numbers
2. Create test groups and add members
3. Upload photos and verify the 48-hour expiration
4. Move on to Phase 3 for the Groups Management UI

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Start the backend
cd implementation/backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Test endpoints (after getting auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/groups
```
